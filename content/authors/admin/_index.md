I'm a Ph.D. student in the Cognition, Brain and Behavior program of the Psychology Department. She grew up in Chile, and moved to the United States to complete her undergraduate studies at Harvard College, where she received a B.A. in Psychology. She subsequently worked in Leah Somervilleâ€™s lab as research manager for the Human Connectome Project in Development, a large-scale multimodal brain study aiming to chart age-related changes in neural network properties in children, adolescents, and adults. 

My current work focuses on the use of smartphones and wearables for the extensive longitudinal assessment of behavior and affect in the individual, and how this intersects with mental and physical health outcomes.
