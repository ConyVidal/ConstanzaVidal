I am a Ph.D. student in the Psychology department at Harvard University, under the supervision of Professor Randy Buckner. I'm interested in understanding how individuals' affect and behavior fluctuate over time, especially as they navigate stressful life experiences, and how this relates to mental and physical health outcomes. My current work uses large datasets collected via smartphones and wearables to study the dynamics of adolescents' experiences of stress, positive and negative affect, and sleep, academic, and social behavior.

I grew up in Chile, lived in Singapore for two years on a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/) scholarship, and moved to the United States for college. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked in Harvard Professor Leah Somervilleâ€™s lab managing the Human Connectome Project in Development, a NIH-funded multimodal brain study charting age-related changes in neural network properties in children, adolescents, and adults.
