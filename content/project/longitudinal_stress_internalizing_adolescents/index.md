title: Identifying Factors linking Stress Exposure with Adolescent Internalizing Psychopathology using High-Frequency Longitudinal Designs
subtitle: 2019-2020

summary: In this intense longitudinal study, we investigated bidirectional monthly and momentary associations between stressful life events and internalizing symptoms, with a focus on the examination of sleep and phone-based social communication as potential mechanisms linking stress exposure to symptoms of anxiety and depresion.

In this intense longitudinal adolescent study, we investigated bidirectional monthly and momentary associations between stressful life events (SLEs) and internalizing symptoms, with a focus on the examination of sleep and phone-based social communication as potential mechanisms linking stress exposure to symptoms of anxiety and depresion. 

30 female adolescents aged 15-17 completed 12 monthly in-lab assessments of SLEs, internalizing symptoms, and positive and negative affect (n=355), and provided continuous sleep and phone communication data via an actigraphy wristband and a phone application, respectively, over the course of a full year (n=6,824 sleep days). Additionally, ecological momentary assessments were collected over four 3-week-long waves across the year, with participants completing three daily surveys of momentary positive and negative affect (n=4,856 individual surveys).
