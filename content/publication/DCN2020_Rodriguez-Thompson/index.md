abstract: "During adolescence, rapid development and reorganization of the dopaminergic system supports increasingly sophisticated reward learning and the ability to exert behavioral control. Disruptions in the ability to exert control over previously rewarded behavior may underlie some forms of adolescent psychopathology. Specifically, symptoms of externalizing psychopathology may be associated with difficulties in flexibly adapting behavior in the context of reward. However, the direct interaction of cognitive control and reward learning in adolescent psychopathology symptoms has not yet been investigated. The present study used a Research Domain Criteria framework to investigate whether behavioral and neuronal indices of inhibition to previously rewarded stimuli underlie individual differences in externalizing symptoms in N = 61 typically developing adolescents. Using a task that integrates the Monetary Incentive Delay and Go-No-Go paradigms, we observed a positive association between externalizing symptoms and activation of the left middle frontal gyrus during response inhibition to cues with a history of reward. These associations were robust to controls for internalizing symptoms and neural recruitment during inhibition of cues with no reward history. Our findings suggest that inhibitory control over stimuli with a history of reward may be a useful marker for future inquiry into the development of externalizing psychopathology in adolescence."
